Hi Chetan,

Great talking with you.

As per our discussion, I am sending a simple rails project, an assignment in the interview process.

"You are suppose to create a Ruby on Rails 4 Image sharing app. Users will be able to sign up on the website via their email address and create their own personal albums. They can upload upto 25 images per album. Users can create any number of albums. Images uploaded by users would also be visible on the home page of the website. All users/visitors can browse any album.

Album would have following properties: Name of the Album, Created Date, Owner
Photos would have following properties: Image, Tag line for photo, Created date and owner

The home page of the website will simply display the last 25 images uploaded and who uploaded it.

User propfile page will display all the albums by that user..
"

You can use any database of your choice. Please also provide a brief README. You are not suppose to spend too much time on UI/UX elements and we can suggest that you use twitter bootstrap to make life simpler. Ensure that your models have appropriate validations required.

Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions and also let us know the latest you will be able to submit this project.
